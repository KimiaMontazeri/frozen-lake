# Frozen Lake with RL

Frozen Lake (an environment from the OpenAI Gym library) is a simple Grid World in which the agent should try to reach the goal in a frozen environment.
In this project, we aim to explore the basic algorithms and concepts of Reinforcement Learning using the FrozenLake environment.
We can also set the `slippery` mode to true in order to have a stochastic environment.

## Algorithms
- Iterative Policy Evaluation
